At this point I have no readership and no one has the foggiest idea what Loyc is, except maybe my non-programmer best friend, Ivan. (In case some random guy reads this, Loyc is the Language of Your Choice, a multi-language compiler that will allow <span style="font-style: italic;">anybody</span> to add new features to existing programming languages.)<br/>


<br/>
Before I try to get anybody on board the project, I need to work out enough design issues to present a reasonable description of its design. I've got some design documents written but not posted on the web yet--I need to re-learn how to upload to sourceforge.net, and the usability of their services is truly awful, at least if one is not a Unix guy. For now I should probably make pages on my local crappy WEBrick server. Then I won't have to upload anything, just move stuff to another folder on my hard drive.<br/>
<br/>
For now you can read the incomplete doc about my <a href="http://qwertie.net/loyc/onep.html">extensible expression parser called ONEP</a>. If anyone clicks on that link I'll be shocked, shocked! I'm excited to announce (to my zero readers) that the C# code for BasicOneParser is complete and you can post a message if you want a copy.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I bought the domain name loyc.net a few months ago; in fact that's how I chose the name of the project: domains for most acronyms are already taken.
