I've made an implementation of Phil Bagwell's VList data structure in C#, with a fairly comprehensive test suite. It comes in two flavors: VList(of T), where you normally add/remove items at the beginning of the list, and RVList(of T), to which you normally add/remove items at the end. It implements the complete IList(of T) interface plus quite a few additional members including AddRange, InsertRange, RemoveRange, Push, and Pop. Converting a VList to a RVList and vice versa is a trivial O(1) operation that appears to reverse the order of the elements. VList and RVList are value types (structs) that contain a reference to the underlying linked list of arrays (VListBlock(of T)). Small lists (0 to 2 items) are optimized with a specialized block class (VListBlockOfTwo(of T)).<br/>

<pre>
void Example()
{
 VList&lt;int&gt; oneTwo = new VList&lt;int&gt;(1, 2);
 VList&lt;int&gt; threeFour = new VList&lt;int&gt;(3, 4);
 VList&lt;int&gt; list = oneTwo;
 VList&lt;int&gt; list2 = threeFour;

 ExpectList(list, 1, 2);
 list.InsertRange(1, threeFour);
 ExpectList(list, 1, 3, 4, 2);
 list2.InsertRange(2, oneTwo);
 ExpectList(list2, 3, 4, 1, 2);

 // oneTwo and ThreeFour are unchanged:
 ExpectList(oneTwo, 1, 2);
 ExpectList(threeFour, 3, 4);
}
static void ExpectList&lt;T&gt;(IList&lt;T&gt; list, params T[] expected)
{
 Assert.AreEqual(expected.Length, list.Count);
 for (int i = 0; i < expected.Length; i++)
  Assert.AreEqual(expected[i], list[i]);
}

I thought that I would use the RVList to implement Loyc's AST to help make it possible to take AST snapshots easily, but I now suspect it's not a good idea. I am still working on the problem.<br/>
<h2>Performance characteristics</h2>Similarly to a persistent linked list, <ul>
<li>Adding an item to the front of a VList or the end of an RVList is always O(1) in time, and often O(1) in space (though, unlike a linked list, it may be much more)</li>
<li>Removing an item from the front of a VList or the end of an RVList is  O(1) in time, although space not necessarily reclaimed.</li> 
<li>Adding or removing an item at the end of a VList or the front of an  RVList is O(N) and requires making a copy of the entire list.</li> 
<li>Inserting or removing a list of M items at the end of a VList or the  front of an RVList is O(N + M).</li> 
<li>Changing an item at an arbitrary position should be avoided, as it performs as poorly as inserting or removing an item at that position.</li> 
</ul> VLists, however, offer some operations that singly-linked lists cannot  provide efficiently: <ul> 
<li>Access by index averages O(1) in ideal conditions</li> 
<li>Getting the list length is typically O(log N), but O(1) in my version</li> 
<li>If a sublist points somewhere within a larger list, its index within the larger list can be obtained in between O(1) and O(log N) time. Consequently, reverse enumeration is possible without creating a  temporary stack or list.</li> 
</ul> Also, VLists can (in the best cases) store data almost as compactly as ordinary arrays.
