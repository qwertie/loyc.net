I've had an intense passion for creating programming languages for over fifteen years. I started writing a specification for my first design around December 1999. In 2007 started "Loyc", which was going to be a multi-syntax compiler based on popular programming languages, but it didn't attract any interest and I abandoned the idea two or three years later. Instead I took up a hobby making [data structures](http://core.loyc.net/collections/) and creating miniature alternatives to popular libraries like NUnit, but these attracted very little interest, especially the fanciest and most difficult family of data structures I created, the ALists. In 2012 I started building the ANTLR competitor [LLLPG](http://ecsharp.net/lllpg) and created LES version 1 as a work product, all in the service of my bigger plan to create Enhanced C#. I wrote all about [LLLPG on CodeProject](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/664785/A-New-Parser-Generator-for-Csharp) and followed up with a [Visual Studio SFG](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/686405/Writing-a-Single-File-Generator) for it. In the end I was able to get a few dozen upvotes, but I could never _confirm_ that I had any users, even after Enhanced C# became available as the input language.

Apparently, nobody wants a language designer.

Even at my last company, which was using a very badly designed 'visual' programming language which had to be edited with their clunky in-house editor, they weren't interested in my offer to help redesign it.

Interest in interoperability, the new focus of Loyc.net, seems to be quite low, too. And I don't really understand that, because I'm pretty sure that a good interoperability framework would be very valuable to the software industry.

My biggest problem seems to be networking: I can't figure out how to pick up friends who are programmers. My second-biggest problem seems to be that C# is a mature ecosystem and that most developers aren't interested in having a LISP-style macro system or other improvements, _unless_ those improvements were made by Microsoft. My third-biggest problem is that I could never figure out how to be hired to work at Roslyn at Microsoft.

And even though I always create software that I really want to exist, other people don't seem to want it, and I don't know why.

So I've been somewhat depressed for the last several months. Enhanced C# feels like a death march; I don't want to leave it in an incomplete state (without a parser that supports all features of C# 7 and whatever features are predicted for C# 8), and for a year or two I have wanted to create a Visual Studio extension that would make EC# more fun and easy to use in a normal C# project. But psychologically I am hurt by the fact that no one cares what I do, that no one is asking me to work on this, and by the overwhelming sense that just like every past project, anything new that I create will inevitably be ignored.

It's one thing not to act because you have an irrational fear about the outcome. It's another thing not to act because you have fifteen years of experience telling you that no matter what you create, the universe won't allow you to have even hundreds, let alone thousands or millions of users. At this point my fears seem completely justified, so I'm paralyzed into doing nothing. Even mustering up the willpower to finally implement LINQ in the EC# parser and printer (relatively small tasks) took weeks.

Loyc is a failure. _Again._ My [blogging](https://medium.com/@qwertie/) and [publication](https://medium.com/big-picture) on Medium aren't winning many hearts either. The family I was born into rarely supports me. I don't know how I will ever manage to believe in myself again.

I need to stop spending my retirement savings and get a fucking job. But living in a small town in the Philippines, software engineering doesn't seem to be in demand, and if it were, the pay would be pretty lousy. My wife doesn't want to live in Manila (oh, I got married recently, by the way.) I have my eye on the west coast of the USA....
