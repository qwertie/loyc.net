For several years I've been building a library themed "things that should be built into the .NET framework, but arenâ€™t". But I kept putting off writing articles about the things in there that should be built-in, but, you know, aren't. No longer!

I don't expect that anyone is actually, you know, reading my blog, but just in case, my specious reader, you are hereby notified that I published several new articles in the last couple of weeks:

- [Arithmetic in generic code](http://core.loyc.net/math/maths.html)
- [The Ambient Service Pattern](http://core.loyc.net/essentials/ambient-service-pattern.html)
- [LINQ-to-Lists](http://core.loyc.net/essentials/linq-to-lists.html)
- [Localize: the easiest way to make your app ready for translations](http://core.loyc.net/essentials/localize.html)
- [Message sinks: a very small logging system](http://core.loyc.net/essentials/messagesink.html)
