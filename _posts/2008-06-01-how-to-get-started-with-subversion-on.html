To get started with <a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/">TortoiseSvn</a> as the admin of a new project:<br/>


<br/>
<ol>
<li>On your SourceForge project page, choose "Subversion" from the "Admin" menu.</li>
<li>Check the box beside "The following box should be checked to enable Subversion:" and click Update. (Note: you may also want to disable CVS from the Admin | CVS page).<br/>
</li>
<li>Prepare the folder that has your source code in it by removing binary files that are generated by your compiler (e.g. remove "bin", "Debug", "Release" folders), so you are only left with files you <span style="font-weight: bold;">want</span> to put in the repository.<br/>
</li>
<li>Install TortoiseSvn if you haven't already.</li>
<li>Assuming your root folder is called "MyProject" and the "unix name" of your project on SourceForge is "myproject", right-click on the <span style="font-style: italic;">MyProject</span> folder (on your hard drive) and choose TortoiseSVN | Import...<br/>
</li>
<li>As <a href="http://alexandria.wiki.sourceforge.net/Subversion+-+Version+Control+for+Source+Code">documented here</a>, use https://<span style="font-style: italic;">myproject</span>.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/<span style="font-style: italic;">myproject</span> as the URL of the repository. Then click OK and your files will be uploaded.<br/>
</li>
<li>Unfortunately, the <span style="font-style: italic;">MyProject</span> folder is still not associated with the repository; you are required to "check out" the files, which means downloading them, in order to complete the association between the files on your computer and the repository. To accomplish this, first rename the <span style="font-style: italic;">MyProject</span> folder to <span style="font-style: italic;">MyProject</span>2--or just delete it, as you probably don't need it anymore. Then make a new <span style="font-style: italic;">MyProject</span> folder, right-click on it and choose "SVN Checkout...". Use the same repository URL as before: https://<span style="font-style: italic;">myproject</span>.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/<span style="font-style: italic;">myproject</span>. Click OK and the files are downloaded.<br/>
</li>
<li>Now when you recompile your project, the object files and stuff will come back (e.g. in "Debug", "Release" folders). You can ensure that TortoiseSVN won't upload a file/folder by right-clicking on the file/folder and choosing TortoiseSVN | Add to ignore list | <span style="font-style: italic;">filename</span>.<br/>
 </li>
<li>After making changes to your program, right click the <span style="font-style: italic;">MyProject</span> folder and choose "SVN Commit..." to upload the changes. TortoiseSVN will update existing files in the repository automatically, but you need to check the check box beside new ("unversioned") files. Then click OK.</li>
<li>When sharing a repository with other people, you must frequently right click the <span style="font-style: italic;">MyProject</span> folder and choose "SVN Update" to download changes made by others. </li>
<li>To learn more about Subversion and TortoiseSVN, read the <span style="font-weight: bold;">truly excellent</span> TortoiseSVN manual, by right-clicking on <span style="font-weight: bold;">any</span> file and choosing TortoiseSVN | Help.</li>
<li>When inviting other developers to your project, point them to <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2006/02/22/QuickstartGuidetoSubversiononSourceForge.aspx">this other handy tutorial</a>.</li>
