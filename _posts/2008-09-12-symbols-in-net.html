I'm a big fan of Ruby's "symbols". Symbols are sort of like strings or enums, but different. Their syntax is an identifier with a colon in front, e.g. :Foo. <a href="http://www.randomhacks.net/articles/2007/01/20/13-ways-of-looking-at-a-ruby-symbol">See here</a> for details.<br/>


<br/>
I love using symbols in place of enums, because if they are implemented properly, comparing two symbols is as fast as comparing two integers (enums). Enums have the problem of non-extensibility; library B can't define new values for an enum in library A. Meanwhile, anybody can define a new symbol at any time.<br/>
<br/>
Via Loyc I would like to add symbol support to C# and boo, but Loyc is a long way off as long as I have nobody to help me. In the meantime, <a href="http://loyc.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/loyc/Src/Runtime/Symbol.cs?view=markup">see here</a> for my current implementation of Symbols in C#.<br/>
<br/>
To simulate enums using Symbols in C#, I just define a static class full of Symbols. For example:<br/>

<pre>public static class Tokens {
  static public readonly Symbol WS = Symbol.Get("WS"); // whitespace
  static public readonly Symbol NEWLINE = Symbol.Get("NEWLINE");
  static public readonly Symbol ID = Symbol.Get("ID"); // identifier
  static public readonly Symbol PUNC = Symbol.Get("PUNC");
  static public readonly Symbol EOS = Symbol.Get("EOS");
  static public readonly Symbol ML_COMMENT = Symbol.Get("ML_COMMENT");
  static public readonly Symbol SL_COMMENT = Symbol.Get("SL_COMMENT");
  ...
}</pre>Enjoy!
