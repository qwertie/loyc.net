For anyone interested in understanding the JavaScript ecosystem so they can start making TypeScript/React apps, I've just posted a detailed four-part tutorial on the subject at [http://typescript-react-primer.loyc.net](http://typescript-react-primer.loyc.net)... with GitHub repo of all the examples [here](https://github.com/qwertie/learn-react). Enjoy!
