My favorite font for programming. Use a black background for vibrant colors.<br/>

In this color scheme I use an off-white (not full intensity) rather than pure white, otherwise the white text seems brighter than everything else. Interestingly, this font is typically bundled with Linux, but IMO it looks significantly better in Windows.
